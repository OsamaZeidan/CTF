## 📂 Files Provided

- One image file (from the MEGA link)

## 🧠 Approach

### 1. Understanding the Challenge
This challenge involves an image that seems visually normal but possibly contains hidden or steganographic information. Our goal is to reveal what data was being sold.

### 2. Initial Observations
Opening the image shows what looks like a low-contrast visual. Upon close inspection, you may sense that layers or hidden patterns exist—classic signs that visual steganography techniques might be involved.

### 3. Tools Used

- **GIMP** (GNU Image Manipulation Program)

## 🧪 Exploitation Process

### Step-by-Step Breakdown Using GIMP

1. **Open the image in GIMP.**
2. **Duplicate the layer** (Right-click the layer → Duplicate Layer).
3. Change the **blend mode** of the duplicated layer to `Difference`.
4. Select the **Move Tool**.
5. Gently **move the top layer horizontally** (left to right).

This manipulation causes overlapping areas with similar content to cancel out and highlights differences—perfect for spotting hidden overlays or messages.

As a result, hidden content emerges clearly.

## 💬 Notes / What I Learned

- Visual steganography can be solved with simple tools like GIMP without coding.
- The `Difference` blend mode is powerful for exposing small changes between layers.
- CTFs can sometimes require a *creative, visual* approach—not just technical ones.
