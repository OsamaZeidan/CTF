🔍 Challenge Description
A suspicious image is provided. Can you uncover the hidden message?
Steganography techniques might be useful here.


📂 Files Provided
- stego_image.jpg → The image suspected of containing hidden data.

🧠 Approach
1. Understanding the Challenge
Given the name “Simple Steganography”, we expect the hidden data to be embedded using basic techniques, such as text stored within the image metadata or common steganographic tools.

🧪 Exploitation Process
🔸 Step 1: Inspecting the Image with strings
Since steganography often involves hidden text, I ran the following command to check for embedded content:
strings stego_image.jpg | less  


Scrolling through the output, I found a potential password for extraction.
🔸 Step 2: Using steghide to Extract Data
Since the challenge hinted at steganography, I attempted to extract any hidden files inside the image using steghide:
steghide extract -sf stego_image.jpeg


Upon entering the password retrieved from strings, the extraction succeeded, revealing a hidden text file containing an encoded flag.
🔸 Step 3: Decoding the Flag with CyberChef
The extracted flag appeared to be Base64-encoded, requiring decoding:
- Opened CyberChef.
- Used the Base64 Decode operation.
- Cleaned up extra characters to reveal the final flag.

💬 Notes / What I Learned
- strings is useful for discovering hidden passwords within files.
- Steghide works well for extracting embedded messages when a password is provided.
- CyberChef is great for Base64 decoding and data cleanup.
